The newly appointed Vice Chancellor of Anna University wanted to create a automated grading system for the students to check their grade. When a student enter a mark, the grading system displays the corresponding grade.

Write a program to solve the given problem.

 

Marks scored

Grade

100

S

(90,100)

A

(80,90)

B

(70,80)

C

(60,70)

D

(50,60)

E

<50

F

 

 

 

The interval [a,b) includes all numbers greater than or equal to a and less than b.

 Input and Output Format:

Input consists of a single integer which corresponds to the marks scored by the student. Print Invalid Input if it is not in the range 0 to 100.

Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

#program

x=int(input())
if(x==100):
    print("S")
elif(x<=99) and (x>=90):
    print("A")
elif(x<=89) and (x>=80):
    print("B")
elif(x<=79) and (x>=70):
    print("C")
elif(x<=69) and (x>=60):
    print("D")
elif(x<=59) and (x>=50):
    print("E")
elif(x<=49):
    print("F")
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
