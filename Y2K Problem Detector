Refer sample input and output for further formatting specifications.

[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output]

#program

by=int(input("Enter year of Birth\n"))
cy=int(input("Enter Current year\n"))
if(by<cy):
    a=(100+cy)-(100+by)
    print(f"Your age is {a}")
else:
    b=(100+cy)-by
    print(f"Your age is {b}")
