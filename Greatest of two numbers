Get two integers a and b from the user and write a python program to relate 2 integers as equal to, less than or greater than. 

Input format: 

Input consist of 2 integers 

The first input corresponds to the first number(a) 

The second input corresponds to the second number(b) 

Output format: 

If the first number is equal to the second number, print "a is equal to b". 

Otherwise, print "a greater than b" or "a less than b"

#program

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
if(a==b):
    print(f"{a} is equal to {b}")
elif(a>b):
    print(f"{a} is greater than {b}")
else:
    print(f"{a} is less than {b}")
